The provided code snippet appears to be a simple implementation of the classic game Snake using the SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) library for graphics and input handling. However, there
are several issues that could potentially cause problems or crashes:

1. **Memory Leaks**:
   - In the `increase_snake()` function, you allocate memory for a new snake segment with `malloc()`. However, if the game is already running out of memory due to other reasons, this
will lead to memory leaks and eventually crash the program.
   - When you call `free(track)` in several places (including the `generate_apple()` function), it's unnecessary because `track` is a local variable and goes out of scope immediately
after that line. The actual issue might be with the pointers `head`, `tail`, etc., but there's no clear indication of how these are updated or freed.
   - You also have `free(track)` in your `generate_apple()` function. This line should probably not exist because, as mentioned before, `track` is a local variable that gets destroyed
immediately after the loop.

2. **Null Pointer Dereferences**:
   - When you call `head->next = newSegment;` or `tail->next = newSegment;`, it's assumed that either `head->next` or `tail->next` is already initialized with some value (most likely
null). If this isn't the case, you'll end up dereferencing a null pointer.
   - In your `generate_apple()` function, when you create a new apple and then call `free(track)`, it's possible that `track` could be null. This would cause another null pointer
dereference.

3. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The logic in the `increase_snake()` function to move the tail based on its direction seems to be incorrect. It doesn't seem to account for cases where the snake wraps around the
screen.
   - When checking if a new apple position collides with any segment of the snake, you might want to add some sort of boundary check (e.g., ensure x and y coordinates are within valid
grid positions).

4. **Magic Numbers**:
   - There are several "magic numbers" scattered throughout your code, especially in color values and coordinate offsets. It would be better to define constants for these values to
improve readability and maintainability.

5. **Typecasting Issues**:
   - In the `increase_snake()` function, you cast an integer to a snake structure pointer with `(Snake*)`, which could potentially lead to typecasting issues if not done correctly.

To fix these issues, make sure you properly initialize all pointers before using them and add checks to prevent null pointer dereferences. Remember to consider edge cases like the game
running out of memory or encountering invalid input.

Here's an example of how you might revise your code based on these suggestions:

```c
void increase_snake() {
    Snake *newSegment = malloc(sizeof(Snake));
    if (newSegment == NULL) {
        printf("ERROR: Out of Memory\n");
        is_game_running = FALSE;
        return;
    }

    // Corrected direction movement logic...
}

void generate_apple() {
    int x, y;
    do {
        x = rand() % CELL_NUMBER_HORZ;
        y = rand() % CELL_NUMBER_VERTC + (number_of_cells_outside_v / 2);

        // Ensure the apple doesn't spawn on snake
        Snake *track = head;
        while(track != NULL) {
            if(track->posX == x && track->posY == y) {
                break; // If collision detected, try again.
            }
            track = track->next;
        }
    } while (track);  // Loop until a non-colliding position is found.

    Apple.posX = x;
    Apple.posY = y;

    return;
}

void setup() {
    // Initialize snake
    reset_snake();

    generate_apple();  // Call the revised generate_apple()

    return;
}
```

Note that this revised code still requires further adjustments based on your specific game requirements. You should review and implement additional checks to ensure your game's logic is
correct and robust.
